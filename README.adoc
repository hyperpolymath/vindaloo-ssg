**Non-deterministic functional-logic site generation in Curry.**
"Vindaloo" — A spicy, multi-layered blend of Haskell-style functional purity and Prolog-style logical search.

== Who Is This For?
* **Constraint-Satisfaction Enthusiasts** who want their SSG to "solve" for the best layout rather than just render it.
* **Researchers** exploring the intersection of lazy evaluation, non-deterministic search, and logical variables.
* **Architects** needing a generator capable of handling ambiguous content relationships and complex taxonomies.
* **Teams** seeking a "search-first" approach to static content orchestration.

== Why vindaloo-ssg?

=== Constraint-Based Synthesis
Define your site structure as a set of constraints (e.g., "This post must be adjacent to a related image, and the total page-weight must not exceed 200kb"). The engine "searches" the solution space to generate the site automatically.

=== Functional Purity + Logical Search
Leveraging the Curry language, you get the best of both worlds: the strictness of algebraic data types and the power of logical variables. This allows for complex, high-level site queries that are impossible in traditional imperative SSGs.

=== Non-Deterministic Layouts
If a layout has multiple valid configurations, `vindaloo-ssg` can explore all possibilities (non-determinism). This is perfect for A/B testing or generating multiple variations of a site from a single source-logic core.

=== Deep Integration with poly-ssg
While the core uses Curry's logic engine, it is bridged to the **poly-ssg-mcp** hub via **ReScript** on **Deno**, allowing modern AI agents to interact with the search-based build process.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Setup the Curry environment (PAKCS or KiCS2) via asdf
just setup

# Run the constraint-based build
# The engine will 'solve' for the optimal site structure
just build

# Type-check and verify constraints without building
just check
----

== Features
* **Logic-Driven Routing** - Use logical variables to define dynamic site paths and relationships.
* **Lazy Evaluation** - Only render what is strictly necessary to satisfy the current search constraints.
* **Podman-First** - Isolated, containerised logic-search environments for **Linux**, **Minix**, and **PC**.
* **Accessibility** - Integrated support for **BSL**, **GSL**, **ASL**, and **Makaton** metadata.
* **Edge-Ready** - Verified for **ASICs** and **Edge tech** via efficient backend emission.

== Requirements
* **PAKCS** or **KiCS2** (Curry Compilers)
* **Deno** (for ReScript/MCP adapters)
* **Just** (Orchestrator)

== Part of poly-ssg
`vindaloo-ssg` provides the constraint-logic and non-deterministic tier of the **poly-ssg** family.
