**Esoteric bitmap-based static site generation in Piet.**
"Easel" — Where the source code is a masterpiece. A generator where the execution path is painted, not typed.

== Who Is This For?
* **Esoteric Language Researchers** exploring non-textual programming paradigms.
* **Visual Thinkers** who want to refactor their SSG logic using a paintbrush or image editor.
* **Security Engineers** interested in visually-obfuscated build toolchains and steganographic logic.
* **Architects** needing to prove that any Turing-complete medium can support the **poly-ssg** standard.

== Why easel-ssg?

=== Chromatic Synthesis
Your generator logic is defined by the transition of hue and lightness between adjacent colour blocks (codels). In `easel-ssg`, site transformations are not lines of code, but gradients of intent.

=== Visual Immutability
The source code is a `.png` bitmap. Unlike text-based scripts that can suffer from character-encoding rot, `easel-ssg` remains static and visually auditable. If the pixel hasn't changed, the logic hasn't changed.

=== Steganographic Metadata
By leveraging the Piet paradigm, frontmatter and site schemas can be embedded directly into the visual noise of the generator's "background", blending site logic with site aesthetics.

=== Deterministic Colour-Cycles
Piet’s execution relies on a Colour Pointer (CP) and a Direction Pointer (DP). `easel-ssg` maps these cycles to your site’s hierarchy, ensuring a predictable, cyclical build process that is mathematically sound.

== Quick Start
[source,oil]
----
# Load the Piet VM environment via asdf
just setup

# Process the source bitmap to synthesise the site
# This executes the .png as a functional SSG core
just build-from-art ./core/logic.png

# Preview the visual source code
just gallery
----

== Features
* **Bitmap-Logic Core** - Execution path determined by colour-cycle transitions.
* **Non-Textual Debugging** - Use standard image manipulation tools to refactor site logic.
* **Podman-First** - Standard containerised toolchain for visual logic execution.
* **Accessibility** - Native metadata support for **BSL**, **GSL**, **ASL**, and **Makaton**.
* **Edge-Ready** - Highly portable VM core suitable for **Minix**, **Android**, and **ASICs**.

== Requirements
* **Piet Interpreter** (npiet or equivalent)
* **Just** (Orchestrator)
* **ImageMagick** (For automated bitmap-to-logic verification)

== Part of poly-ssg
`easel-ssg` is the visual, esoteric member of the **poly-ssg** family, unified through **MCP** integration.
